  <h1>Bridgewalker acquired by Hive</h1>
  <span class="post-date">29 Dec 2013</span>
  <p>Welcome to the Bridgewalker Blog! The news is already a couple of weeks old, but
I would like to use this first post to report that Bridgewalker has been
acquired be <a href="http://www.grabhive.com/">Hive</a>!</p>

<p>I was lucky to meet Wendell Davis at the Amsterdam Bitcoin conference in
September and we had some great conversations about Bitcoin wallets and the
Bitcoin ecosystem in general. So when he later approached me with the idea of
Hive acquiring Bridgewalker and me joining the team, it did not take much
convincing for me to decide that this was a great match and opportunity.</p>

<p>I am very excited about joining the Hive team and looking forward to building
some great products. I will be focusing initally on helping out with the Android
port of Hive, which will put Bridgewalker a little bit on the back burner for
the time being. But it will continue to operate and I am looking forward to
explore future possibilites of integerating it with the rest of Hive's
offerings.</p>

<p>Watch this space for some cool additional announcements resulting from the
acquisition!</p>
